      Timetable for IPv4 to Deprecated and then Historical Status
                     draft-latour-shutdown-ipv4.txt

Abstract

   IPv4 is unsustainable on the global internet.  The increasing costs
   and declining performance of IPv4 based systems due to address
   overload are an unsustainable burden that is not only costly in terms
   of operational money, but also in placing artificial constraints on
   further development and by reducing the quality of the user
   experience.

   IPv4 will die a natural death, but waiting for it to do so will take
   many more years than is currently desirable.  Therefore, this I-D
   proposes to set a flag date to declare IPv4 no longer be supported as
   a globally routed protocol on the internet.  The authors recognize
   that pockets of IPv4 for various specialized applications will endure
   for years and possibly even decades to come.  However, at the time of
   writing, IPv4 is the current "lingua franca" of the internet.  We
   propose to declare a date certain by which IPv6 will become the
   "lingua franca".

Internet-Draft                shutdown-IPv4                February 2016


1.  Introduction

   Why is this needed ?

   IPv4 is over 30 years old!

   Dual-stack is the way to go for a while, but eventually the depletion
   of IPv4 addresses will cause IPv6 only infrastructure and services to
   segment the Internet, those on IPv6 only and those IPv4 only.  If the
   majority of the growth on the Internet will be IPv6, we'll be left
   with small and isolated IPv4 networks.  It's time to look at those
   networks now and see what can be done today to ensure they are part
   of the IPv6 infrastructure.  Certainly the commercial entities will
   not support expensive IPv4 support too long if there are only a few
   isolated IPv4 only subnets.

   Dual stack is an interim solution to a real problem, dual-stack has a
   cost, it's expensive to operate and doubles the security exposure.
   Dual-stack is temporary.

   The dates specified are suggestion only and need to be agreed on,
   they are to provoke a reaction, to think about the impacts of
   shutting down IPv4, to think of the global actions we need to take in
   order to have an IPv6 only Internet.

   There are many reasons to do this, but the most obvious one is that
   progress on any task without a specific deadline tends to proceed at
   a slower pace than one with a deadline.  In this case, the lack of a
   deadline has lead o a 20+ year procrastination in deployment of IPv6.
   We have been suffering the consequences of IPv4 address shortage
   since the first deployment of NAT for address conservation.  This has
   gone on for so long that there are those who have moved beyond
   acceptance of these limitations to a form of Stockholm syndrom-like
   support for NAT.  Even with the various address sharing technologies
   and their attendant tradeoffs, IPv4 is strained and we are seeing
   increasing costs in operations, in address acquisition, and in
   various other aspects of maintaining an IPv4 network.  In short, with
   IPv4, we are continually paying more to continually receive a less
   beneficial network.

   By setting a date certain for the deprecation and eventual historical
   status of IPv4, the IETF can send a clear signal to developers,
   operators, administrators, and even the financial markets that this
   change is vital and necessary to the sustainable operation of the
   internet and that plans are in place for achieving this goal.

   In terms if timelines, we propose to deprecate IPv4 in 2022/02/01 and
   move the status to historical on 2024/04/04.

2.  Notational Conventions

2.1.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal ?

   The primary goal of this I-D is to define key dates and document a
   timeline and action plan that for the discontinuation of the IPv4
   protocol on the global Internet.  The dates need to be aggressive
   enough to avoid further deployment procrastination.

   The dates need to allow sufficient time to identity potential IPv4
   only networks (those who can't afford to upgrade their IPv4 only
   network equipment) and plan for upgrades.

3.1.  When ?

   The target date to have an IPv6 only Internet is April 4, 2024.

3.2.  Can I still use IPv4 in my Internal networks?

   Yes, IPv4 can exist inside Internal networks, IPv4 can be tunneled
   over IPv6 on the global Internet.  This I-D only addresses IPv4 on
   the global Internet.

4.  Multiphase IPv4 deprecation

   A phased approach is recommended over a few years to gradually remove
   the dependence on IPv4.
   We should start deprecating IPv4 names and finish with removing all
   global Internet IPv4 routes.

5.  Remove IPv4 from TLD Registries and Root zone

   Remove IPv4 NS records Remove IPv4 glue records Remove IPv4 registry
   access, EPP access

5.1.  Execution Date

   This phase is schedule for 2022/02/01

5.2.  Expected Impact

   TLD Domains names are IPv6 only The majority of Internet traffic is
   over IPv6

6.  Remove IPv4 from IANA Registries

   ARPA zone management, remove all IPv4 related zones; Remove in-
   addr.arpa Remove IPv4 in as112.arpa Remove any IANA IPv4 references

6.1.  Execution Date

   This phase is schedule for 2023/02/01

6.2.  Expected Impact

   Find pockets of IPv4 that are lagging on the migration Reverse DNS is
   IPv6 only The vast majority of Internet traffic is over IPv6

7.  Remove IPv4 from AS Operator

   This is the last step in shutting down IPv4, remove IPv4 routes from
   all AS operator.

7.1.  Execution Date

   This phase is schedule for 2024/02/01

7.2.  Expected Impact

   Smaller core Internet routers.
   Reduced operating costs.
   Big Party!

8.  IPv4 as Historical Status

   That's it for IPv4.  List all the thing to make IPv4 Historical

8.1.  Execution Date

   This phase is schedule for 2024/04/04

8.2.  Expected Impact

   Business as usual

9.  Security considerations

   This will hopefully make the Internet more scalable, secure and cost
   effective to operate and manage.

10.  IANA Actions

   Lots, TBD

11.  Internationalization Considerations

   This protocol is designed for machine to machine communications
