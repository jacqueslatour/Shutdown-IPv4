                     Shutdown IPv4 on April 4, 2024
                     draft-latour-shutdown-ipv4.txt

Abstract

   IPv4 can't live on the Internet forever and it is unrealistic to wait
   for a natural 'death'.  We need to set a fixed date to shut IPv4
   down.  The goals is to remove IPv4 global routing on the Internet and
   to remove all IPv4 registrations entries in the IANA registry, the
   root zone and TLDs.  The goal is to enforce implementation of IPv6
   and to have a single protocol Internet, easy to manage and operate.
   The scope is the public Internet and not internal networks.
   Enterprise and organization that want to use IPv4 internally can do
   so forever.  One good method to force change is to set a date by
   which we can drive human behaviour to implement IPv6.  The date is
   April 4, 2024.

1.  Introduction

   Why is this needed ? IPv4 is over XX years old!  The Internet over
   IPv4 is not scalable to meet our future needs Moving away from IPv4
   is going to be a very difficult challenge, one that must be planned
   well and executed well to minimize operational impacts.  With the
   advent of the Internet of Things, we will be adding a few billion
   devices to the Internet i going ot break IPv4.  Lots has been written
   on this.  Today, we have to manage two networks, to manage security
   for IPv4, IPv6 As of writing, we have 8 years 3 months to get this
   right, to fix the remaining protocol and implementation issues.

2.  Notational Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   IPv4.
   IPv6.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  What is the goal ?

   The primary goal is to have a single protocol Internet,

3.1.  When ?

   The target date to have an IPv4 free Internet is April 4, 2024.

3.2.  Why A fixed date ?

   Planning is required to migrate all Internet services to IPv6.

3.3.  Can I still use IPv4 in my Internal networks?

   Yes, IPv4 can exist inside Internal networks,
   IPv4 can be tunnelled over IPv6 on the Internet.

4.  Multiphase IPv4 deprecation ?

   A phase approach should be used to gradually remove the dependence on
   IPv4.

   Start with names; remove IPv4 from name registries IANA; remove IPv4
   from IANA registry All AS Operator; remove IPv4 routes from all core
   Internet routers

5.  Remove IPv4 from TLD Registries and Root zone

   Remove IPv4 NS records Remove IPv4 glue records Remove IPv4 registry
   access, EPP access

5.1.  Execution Date

   This could be performed a period of time before the target date

5.2.  Expected Impact

   Domains names are IPv6 only The vast majority of Internet traffic is
   over IPv6

6.  Remove IPv4 from IANA Registries

   ARPA zone management, remove all IPv4 related zones; Remove in-
   addr.arpa Remove IPv4 in as112.arpa

6.1.  Expected Impact

7.  Remove IPv4 from AS Operator

   This is the last step in shutting down IPv4, remove IPv4 routes from
   all AS operator.

7.1.  Expected Impact

   Smaller core Internet routers.
   Reduced operating costs.

8.  Security considerations

   This will hopefully make the Internet more scalable, secure and cost
   effective to operate and manage.

9.  IANA Actions

   Lots, TBD

10.  Internationalization Considerations

   This protocol is designed for machine to machine communications
