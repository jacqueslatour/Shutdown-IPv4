<abstract>
<t>IPv4 can’t live on the Internet forever and it is unrealistic to wait for a natural ‘death’.
We need to set a fixed date to shut IPv4 down. The goals is to remove IPv4 global routing on
the Internet and to remove all IPv4 registrations entries in the IANA registry, the root zone and TLDs.
The goal is to enforce implementation of IPv6 and to have a single protocol Internet, easy to manage and operate.
The scope is the public Internet and not internal networks.  Enterprise and organization that want
to use IPv4 internally can do so forever.  One good method to force change is to set a date by which
we can drive human behaviour to implement IPv6. The date is April 4, 2024.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Why is this needed ?
IPv4 is over XX years old!
The Internet over IPv4 is not scalable to meet our future needs
Moving away from IPv4 is going to be a very difficult challenge, one that must be planned well and executed well
to minimize operational impacts.
With the advent of the Internet of Things, we will be adding a few billion devices to the Internet is going to break IPv4.
Lots has been written on this.
Today, we have to manage two networks, to manage security for IPv4, IPv6
As of writing, we have 8 years 3 months to get this right, to fix the remaining protocol and implementation issues.
