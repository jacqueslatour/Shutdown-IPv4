<abstract>
<t>IPv4 is unsustainable on the global internet. The increasing costs and declining performance
of IPv4 based systems due to address overload are an unsustainable burden that is not only
costly in terms of operational money, but also in placing artificial constraints on further
development and by reducing the quality of the user experience.
</t>
<t>IPv4 will die a natural death, but waiting for it to do so will take many more years than
is currently desirable. Therefore, this I-D proposes to set a flag date to declare IPv4
no longer be supported as a globally routed protocol on the internet. The authors recognize
that pockets of IPv4 for various specialized applications will endure for years and possibly
even decades to come. However, at the time of writing, IPv4 is the current “lingua franca” of
the internet. We propose to declare a date certain by which IPv6 will become the “lingua
franca”.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Why is this needed ?
</t>
<t>IPv4 is over 30 years old!
</t>
<t>There are many reasons to do this, but the most obvious one is that progress on any task
without a specific deadline tends to proceed at a slower pace than one with a deadline.
In this case, the lack of a deadline has lead o a 20+ year procrastination in deployment
of IPv6. We have been suffering the consequences of IPv4 address shortage since the first
deployment of NAT for address conservation. This has gone on for so long that there are
those who have moved beyond acceptance of these limitations to a form of Stockholm
syndrom-like support for NAT. Even with the various address sharing technologies and
their attendant tradeoffs, IPv4 is strained and we are seeing increasing costs in operations,
in address acquisition, and in various other aspects of maintaining an IPv4 network.
In short, with IPv4, we are continually paying more to continually receive a less
beneficial network.
</t>
<t>By setting a date certain for the deprecation and eventual historical status of IPv4,
the IETF can send a clear signal to developers, operators, administrators, and even
the financial markets that this change is vital and necessary to the sustainable operation
of the internet and that plans are in place for achieving this goal.
</t>
<t>In terms if timelines, we propose to deprecate IPv4 in 2021/02/01 and move the status to historical on
2014/04/04.
