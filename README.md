Hi!
Looking for assistance on this ID.

IPv4 can’t live on the Internet forever and it is unrealistic to wait for a natural ‘death’.
We need to set a fixed date to shut IPv4 down. The goals is to remove IPv4 global routing on
the Internet and to remove all IPv4 registrations entries in the IANA registries. The goal is to 
enforce implementation of IPv6 and to have a single protocol Internet, easy to manage and operate.
The scope is the public Internet and not internal networks.  Enterprise and organization that want 
to use IPv4 internally can do so forever.  One good method to force change is to set a date by which
we can drive human behaviour to implement IPv6. The date is April 4, 2014.
